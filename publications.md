      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a brain circuit intervention that can modulate distinct neural pathways for the alleviation of neurological symptoms in patients with brain disorders. In Parkinson's disease, subthalamic DBS clinically mimics the effect of dopaminergic drug treatment, but the shared pathway mechanisms on cortex-basal ganglia networks are unknown. To address this critical knowledge gap, we combined fully-invasive neural multisite recordings in patients undergoing DBS surgery with MRI-based whole-brain connectomics.<br>
      <br>
      Our findings demonstrate that dopamine and DBS exert distinct mesoscale effects through modulation of local neural population synchrony. In contrast, at the macroscale, DBS mimics dopamine in its suppression of excessive interregional network synchrony associated with indirect and hyperdirect cortex-basal ganglia pathways. Our results provide a better understanding of the circuit mechanisms of dopamine and DBS, laying the foundation for advanced closed-loop neurostimulation therapies.

      A recent focus in the development of music recommendation systems is the incorporation of physiological signals. Among this, the possibility of using non-invasive, electroencephalography-based neural activity is of great interest. In this preliminary work, we sought to predict the preference of individuals for previously unheard music through a combination of acoustic and neural features. We developed a real-time system for preference decoding which was used to skip songs with ∼80 ms latency according to users’ desires. The results suggest that music recommendation systems could supplement acoustic features with neural activity for characterising an individual’s music preferences in real time, with options to incorporate further acoustic and physiological information for improved system accuracy.

      Various forms of information can be extracted from electrophysiology data. Of this, phase-amplitude coupling, time delays, and non-sinusoidal waveshape characteristics are of great interest, providing mechanistic insights into physiology and pathology. However, methods commonly used for these analyses possess notable limitations. Recent work has revealed the bispectrum - the Fourier transform of the third order moment - to be a powerful tool for the analysis of electrophysiology data, overcoming many such limitations. Here we present PyBispectra, a package for bispectral analyses including phase-amplitude coupling, time delays, and non-sinusoidal waveshape.

      Brain computer interface research can inspire closed-loop neuromodulation therapies, promising an unprecedented spatiotemporal precision for the treatment of brain disorders. Decoding dynamic patient states from brain signals with machine learning is required to leverage this precision, but a standardized framework for invasive brain signal decoding from neural implants does not exist. Here, we developed a platform that integrates brain signal decoding with MRI connectomics and demonstrate its utility across 123 hours of invasively recorded brain data from 73 neurosurgical patients treated with brain implants for movement disorders, depression and epilepsy.<br>
      <br>
      First, we introduce connectomics-informed movement decoders that generalize across cohorts with Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy from the US, Europe and China. Next, we reveal network targets for emotion decoding in left prefrontal and cingulate circuits in DBS patients with major depression. Finally, we showcase opportunities to improve seizure detection in responsive neurostimulation for epilepsy. Our study highlights the clinical utility of brain signal decoding for deep brain stimulation and provides methods that allow for rapid, high-accuracy decoding for precision medicine approaches that can dynamically adapt neurotherapies in response to the individual needs of patients.

      Invasive brain signal decoding can revolutionize the clinical utility of neurotechnological therapies. Potential signal sources stem from electroencephalography (EEG), electrocorticography (ECoG) and local field potentials (LFP) recorded from deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes. The application of machine learning methods to these signals requires pre-processing and feature extraction – complex analyses, often lacking standardization and clear documentation. Here, we introduce py_neuromodulation, a toolbox designed for standardized signal processing, feature extraction, and decoding of electrophysiological data. All parameters are explicitly defined in dedicated settings and channel parameterization files. The framework processes both data streamed in real-time and from recordings on disk using the same pipeline. Additionally, a browser-based graphical user interface (GUI) enables intuitive usage and visualization of the processing pipeline without requiring any code modification.<br>
      <br>
      By introducing py_neuromodulation, we aim to simplify and standardize the analysis of electrophysiological recordings, facilitating reproducibility and accessibility in the field of brain signal decoding. Our tool bridges the fields of neuroscience and neural engineering, providing machine learning and neurotechnology researchers with reproducible methods for the development of generalizable machine learning algorithms.

      Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) provides unprecedented spatiotemporal precision for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), allowing for direct real-time state-specific adjustments. Inspired by findings from optogenetic stimulation in mice, we hypothesized that STN-DBS effects on movement speed depend on ongoing movement kinematics that patients exhibit during stimulation. To investigate this hypothesis, we implemented a motor state-dependent closed-loop neurostimulation algorithm, adapting DBS burst delivery to ongoing movement speed in 24 PD patients.<br>
      <br>
      We found a stronger anti-bradykinetic effect, raising movement speed to the level of healthy controls, when STN-DBS was applied during fast but not slow movements, while only stimulating 5% of overall movement time. To study underlying brain circuits and neurophysiological mechanisms, we investigated the behavioral effects with MRI connectomics and motor cortex electrocorticography. Finally, we demonstrate that machine learning-based brain signal decoding can be used to predict continuous movement speed for fully embedded state-dependent closed-loop algorithms. Our findings provide novel insights into the state-dependency of invasive neuromodulation, which could inspire advanced state-dependent neurostimulation algorithms for brain disorders.

      Deep brain stimulation offers a unique opportunity to record neural activity of the basal ganglia. While much work in dystonia has focused on the globus pallidus internus, expanding research to investigate subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity in various dystonia types is critical to provide a comprehensive understanding of dystonia pathophysiology. STN and cortex activity were recorded from 17 patients with cervical dystonia (CD), 19 with Meige syndrome, and 9 with generalized dystonia (GD) during the lead externalized period. We investigated local and network oscillatory characteristics, including power, bursts, and coherence. Additionally, we explored the relationship between these features and the severity of dystonic symptoms within each group and conducted a comparative analysis across the different dystonia types.<br>
      <br>
      Peaks of low-frequency (4–13 Hz) and beta (14–30 Hz) power were present in the STN of all patients; most of the beta peaks are distributed in the high beta range (20–30 Hz). The CD and GD groups showed longer low-frequency bursts and greater high beta power in STN than the Meige group. Interestingly, the CD group showed stronger STN-cortex low-frequency coherence, while the GD group had stronger STN-cortex high beta coherence. Combined, low-frequency and beta features could predict symptom severity with a performance of 73% in the CD group and 82% in the GD group. Low-frequency and high-beta oscillations are present in the STN across all three types of dystonia. The distinct patterns may be associated with different underlying pathological mechanisms.

      Parkinson's disease is linked to increased beta oscillations in the subthalamic nucleus, which correlate with motor symptoms. However, findings across studies have varied. Our standardized analysis of multicenter datasets reveals that insufficient sample sizes contributed to these discrepancies - a challenge we address by pooling datasets into one large cohort (n=119). Moving beyond beta power, we disentangled spectral components reflecting distinct neural processes.<br>
      <br>
      Combining aperiodic offset, low beta, and low gamma oscillations explained significantly more variance in symptom severity than beta alone. Moreover, interhemispheric within-patient analyses showed that, unlike beta oscillations, aperiodic broadband power - likely reflecting spiking activity - was increased in the more affected hemisphere. These findings identify aperiodic broadband power as a potential biomarker for adaptive deep brain stimulation and provide novel insights into the relationship between subthalamic hyperactivity and motor symptoms in human Parkinson's disease.

      The ability to initiate volitional action is fundamental to human behaviour. Loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease is associated with impaired action initiation, also termed akinesia. Both dopamine and subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) can alleviate akinesia, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. An important question is whether dopamine and DBS facilitate de novo build-up of neural dynamics for motor execution or accelerate existing cortical movement initiation signals through shared modulatory circuit effects. Answering these questions can provide the foundation for new closed-loop neurotherapies with adaptive DBS, but the objectification of neural processing delays prior to performance of volitional action remains a significant challenge.<br>
      <br>
      To overcome this challenge, we studied readiness potentials and trained brain signal decoders on invasive neurophysiology signals in 25 DBS patients (12 female) with Parkinson's disease during performance of self-initiated movements. Combined sensorimotor cortex electrocorticography and subthalamic local field potential recordings were performed OFF therapy (n = 22), ON dopaminergic medication (n = 18) and on subthalamic deep brain stimulation (n = 8). This allowed us to compare their therapeutic effects on neural latencies between the earliest cortical representation of movement intention as decoded by linear discriminant analysis classifiers and onset of muscle activation recorded with electromyography.<br>
      <br>
      In the hypodopaminergic OFF state, we observed long latencies between motor intention and motor execution for readiness potentials and machine learning classifications. Both, dopamine and DBS significantly shortened these latencies, hinting towards a shared therapeutic mechanism for alleviation of akinesia. To investigate this further, we analysed directional cortico-subthalamic oscillatory communication with multivariate granger causality. Strikingly, we found that both therapies independently shifted cortico-subthalamic oscillatory information flow from antikinetic beta (13–35 Hz) to prokinetic theta (4–10 Hz) rhythms, which was correlated with latencies in motor execution.<br>
      <br>
      Our study reveals a shared brain network modulation pattern of dopamine and DBS that may underlie the acceleration of neural dynamics for augmentation of movement initiation in Parkinson's disease. Instead of producing or increasing preparatory brain signals, both therapies modulate oscillatory communication. These insights provide a link between the pathophysiology of akinesia and its’ therapeutic alleviation with oscillatory network changes in other non-motor and motor domains, e.g. related to hyperkinesia or effort and reward perception. In the future, our study may inspire the development of clinical brain computer interfaces based on brain signal decoders to provide temporally precise support for action initiation in patients with brain disorders.

      Various forms of information can be extracted from neural timeseries data. Of this information, phase-amplitude coupling, time delays, and waveform characteristics are of great interest, providing crucial insights into neuronal function and dysfunction. However, the methods commonly used for analysing these features possess notable limitations. For example, quantifying phase-amplitude coupling with the popular modulation index requires the challenging definition of precise filter settings and is susceptible to source-mixing artefacts – as is time delay estimation with the traditional cross-correlation – and timeseries-based waveform analysis necessitates preprocessing steps that risk corrupting the shape of the underlying signal. In contrast, recent work has revealed the bispectrum – the Fourier transform of the third order moment – to be a powerful tool for the analysis of phase-amplitude coupling, time delay estimation, and non-sinusoidal waveform characteristics in neural signals. In fact, the bispectrum is immune to the above limitations, leaving a computationally efficient and robust tool for various signal analysis contexts. Despite these advantages, the bispectrum has seen relatively little use in the field of neuroscience, in part due to the lack of an accessible, easy-to-use toolbox.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, we have created PyBispectra: an open-source Python-based toolbox providing the wider neuroscientific community with access to these advanced methods. PyBispectra includes tools for performing phase-amplitude coupling, time delay estimation, and waveform analysis – incorporating recent methodological improvements – as well as additional supporting tools based on recommendations from the literature for other cross-frequency coupling methods and spatio-spectral filtering. The toolbox is highly accessible with detailed API documentation and tutorials, and is written using object-oriented principles to support ease of understanding and adaptation of the source code. Finally, PyBispectra is a high-performance toolbox, incorporating parallel processing and low-level source code compilation to maximise compute speed. Altogether, bispectrum-based methods bring numerous advantages over traditional approaches, and PyBispectra offers neuroscience researchers access to these advanced signal processing methods in an open-source, easy-to-use toolbox.

      Effective connectivity analyses are a common approach for analysing electrophysiological data, characterising the interaction between timeseries signals in a frequency-resolved manner. Various methods exist for performing such analyses, with the traditional approach being generally bivariate, i.e. between two signals. However, when handling data from multi-channel setups – as is often the case in electrophysiology – examining the connectivity between each combination of signals results in high-dimensional results that are difficult to interpret. A common approach to handle this is to average the results across multiple connections, diminishing the signal-to-noise ratio if the interaction of interest is not present across all connections. In contrast, multivariate connectivity methods characterise interactions between two sets of signals, representing relationships between these groups in the component space. In this way, critical connectivity information is represented in a low-dimensional, more interpretable manner. Additionally, the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio offered by multivariate methods allows for interactions to be captured which may otherwise be lost with less sophisticated bivariate methods. A major factor in the limited uptake of multivariate methods is their lack of availability in popular signal processing packages.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, we developed implementations of multivariate methods based on coherency and state-space Granger causality in MNE-Connectivity, a toolbox for estimating effective connectivity that extends the popular open-source MNE-Python signal processing toolbox .toolbox (Gramfort et al., 2013). To further promote their adoption, example use cases of these tools are presented as tutorials in the MNE-Connectivity documentation.

      Building on earlier work, this poster shows results of the first-ever within-subject examination of cortico-subthalamic interaction in Parkinson's disease across medication and deep brain stimulation states using invasive recordings of subthalamic nucleus local field potentials and the cortex with electrocorticography. The results highlight that dopamine and stimulation alter distinct aspects of communication with unique spectral profiles, and further supports a role for cortico-subthalamic interactions in Parkinson's disease pathology.

      Various forms of information can be extracted from neural timeseries data. Of this information, phase-amplitude coupling, time delays, and waveform characteristics are of great interest, providing crucial insights into neuronal function and dysfunction. However, the methods commonly used for analysing these features possess notable limitations. For example, quantifying phase-amplitude coupling with the popular modulation index requires the challenging definition of precise filter settings and is susceptible to source-mixing artefacts – as is time delay estimation with the traditional cross-correlation – and timeseries-based waveform analysis necessitates preprocessing steps that risk corrupting the shape of the underlying signal. In contrast, recent work has revealed the bispectrum – the Fourier transform of the third order moment – to be a powerful tool for the analysis of phase-amplitude coupling, time delay estimation, and non-sinusoidal waveform characteristics in neural signals. In fact, the bispectrum is immune to the above limitations, leaving a computationally efficient and robust tool for various signal analysis contexts. Despite these advantages, the bispectrum has seen relatively little use in the field of neuroscience, in part due to the lack of an accessible, easy-to-use toolbox.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, we have created PyBispectra: an open-source Python-based toolbox providing the wider neuroscientific community with access to these advanced methods. PyBispectra includes tools for performing phase-amplitude coupling, time delay estimation, and waveform analysis – incorporating recent methodological improvements – as well as additional supporting tools based on recommendations from the literature for other cross-frequency coupling methods and spatio-spectral filtering. The toolbox is highly accessible with detailed API documentation and tutorials, and is written using object-oriented principles to support ease of understanding and adaptation of the source code. Finally, PyBispectra is a high-performance toolbox, incorporating parallel processing and low-level source code compilation to maximise compute speed. Altogether, bispectrum-based methods bring numerous advantages over traditional approaches, and PyBispectra offers neuroscience researchers access to these advanced signal processing methods in an open-source, easy-to-use toolbox.

      Building on our earlier work in the Interventional and Cognitive Neuromodulation group of Wolf-Julian Neumann, this poster shows results of the first-ever examination of cortico-subthalamic interaction in Parkinson's disease in different dopaminergic medication and stimulation conditions using invasive recordings of subthalamic nucleus local field potentials and the cortex with electrocorticography. These results highlight pathological changes in cortico-subthalamic connectivity that are differentially altered by medication and stimulation.

      This poster shows preliminary results of the first-ever examination of cortico-subthalamic interaction in Parkinson's disease in different dopaminergic medication conditions using invasive recordings of subthalamic nucleus local field potentials and the cortex with electrocorticography. These early results indicate that further analyses may address fundamental issues regarding pathological frequency band networks in Parkinson's disease, as well as the mechanisms of dopaminergic medication on these networks.

      Voluntary movements are usually preceded by a slow, negative-going brain signal over motor areas, the so-called readiness potential (RP). To date, the exact nature and causal role of the RP in movement preparation have remained heavily debated. Although the RP is influenced by several motorical and cognitive factors, it has remained unclear whether people can learn to exert mental control over their RP, for example, by deliberately suppressing it. If people were able to initiate spontaneous movements without eliciting an RP, this would challenge the idea that the RP is a necessary stage of the causal chain leading up to a voluntary movement.<br>
      <br>
      We tested the ability of participants to control the magnitude of their RP in a neurofeedback experiment. Participants performed self-initiated movements, and after every movement, they were provided with immediate feedback about the magnitude of their RP. They were asked to find a strategy to perform voluntary movements such that the RPs were as small as possible. We found no evidence that participants were able to to willfully modulate or suppress their RPs while still eliciting voluntary movements. This suggests that the RP might be an involuntary component of voluntary action over which people cannot exert conscious control.
