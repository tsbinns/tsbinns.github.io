            Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a brain circuit intervention that can modulate distinct neural pathways for the alleviation of neurological symptoms in patients with brain disorders. In Parkinson's disease, subthalamic DBS clinically mimics the effect of dopaminergic drug treatment, but the shared pathway mechanisms on cortex-basal ganglia networks are unknown. To address this critical knowledge gap, fully-invasive neural multisite recordings in patients undergoing DBS surgery were combined with MRI-based whole-brain connectomics.<br>
            <br>
            The findings demonstrate that dopamine and DBS exert distinct mesoscale effects through modulation of local neural population synchrony. In contrast, at the macroscale, DBS mimics dopamine in its suppression of excessive interregional network synchrony associated with indirect and hyperdirect cortex-basal ganglia pathways. Our results provide a better understanding of the circuit mechanisms of dopamine and DBS, laying the foundation for advanced closed-loop neurostimulation therapies.

            The readiness potential (RP) is a slow, negative electrical potential preceding voluntary actions observed in EEG recordings. According to the classical interpretation, the RP reflects movement preparation and should only be found immediately prior to voluntary action. In contrast, the stochastic accumulator model argues that the RP is the result of accumulated neural activity and does not reflect movement preparation. One prediction derived from this accumulator model is that events resembling the RP should be found throughout the EEG data of tasks where voluntary actions are permitted. This prediction was tested using machine learning techniques.<br>
            <br>
            Events resembling the spatio-temporal profiles of the RP were identified in the EEG data, however there were discrepancies between these events and details of the prediction of the model. Yet, these events were not found to be false positives resulting from noise in the EEG recordings, raising the possibility that these events were related to voluntary action and the RP in some manner. This provides tentative support for the stochastic accumulator model.

            The dendritic plateau potential is thought to shape information processing in striatal projection neurons. The effect of cholinergic and dopaminergic modulation on the plateau potential and the spiking activity of striatal projection neurons was investigated <i>in silico</i>. Plateau potentials were generated with spatially clustered excitatory inputs to dendrites, and the efficacy of cortico-striatal inputs at triggering cell spiking in the presence and absence of cholinergic and dopaminergic modulation were observed.<br>
            <br>
            There were some instances of dopaminergic modulation in which the probabilities of cells spiking were altered, however changes in spiking were largely attributed to alterations in cell excitability. It is concluded that acetylcholine and dopamine do not influence striatal information processing through altering plateau potentials induced by clustered excitatory inputs, with the persistence of the plateau potential supporting its proposed essential role in striatal information processing.

      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a brain circuit intervention that can modulate distinct neural pathways for the alleviation of neurological symptoms in patients with brain disorders. In Parkinson's disease, subthalamic DBS clinically mimics the effect of dopaminergic drug treatment, but the shared pathway mechanisms on cortex-basal ganglia networks are unknown. To address this critical knowledge gap, we combined fully-invasive neural multisite recordings in patients undergoing DBS surgery with MRI-based whole-brain connectomics.<br>
      <br>
      Our findings demonstrate that dopamine and DBS exert distinct mesoscale effects through modulation of local neural population synchrony. In contrast, at the macroscale, DBS mimics dopamine in its suppression of excessive interregional network synchrony associated with indirect and hyperdirect cortex-basal ganglia pathways. Our results provide a better understanding of the circuit mechanisms of dopamine and DBS, laying the foundation for advanced closed-loop neurostimulation therapies.

      A recent focus in the development of music recommendation systems is the incorporation of physiological signals. Among this, the possibility of using non-invasive, electroencephalography-based neural activity is of great interest. In this preliminary work, we sought to predict the preference of individuals for previously unheard music through a combination of acoustic and neural features. We developed a real-time system for preference decoding which was used to skip songs with ∼80 ms latency according to users’ desires. The results suggest that music recommendation systems could supplement acoustic features with neural activity for characterising an individual’s music preferences in real time, with options to incorporate further acoustic and physiological information for improved system accuracy.

      Various forms of information can be extracted from electrophysiology data. Of this, phase-amplitude coupling, time delays, and non-sinusoidal waveshape characteristics are of great interest, providing mechanistic insights into physiology and pathology. However, methods commonly used for these analyses possess notable limitations. Recent work has revealed the bispectrum - the Fourier transform of the third order moment - to be a powerful tool for the analysis of electrophysiology data, overcoming many such limitations. Here we present PyBispectra, a package for bispectral analyses including phase-amplitude coupling, time delays, and non-sinusoidal waveshape.
