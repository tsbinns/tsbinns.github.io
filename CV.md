    </p>
    <p class="CV-desc">
      My placement at the Bernstein Center was funded by an Erasmus+ Traineeship grant, with the core theme of my work being the investigation of choice-predictive brain signals and the study of movement initiation. My tasks involved designing and conducting EEG experiments, with extensive analysis of EEG data using MATLAB, Python, and SPSS. As part of this work, I co-authored a research article that has been published in the journal eNeuro. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1523/eneuro.0425-20.2020"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a><br>
      Through this placement I developed an in-depth understanding of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces and machine learning techniques, and furthered my understanding of core concepts such as linear algebra, calculus, signal analysis, and statistics. Additionally, I gained experience as a researcher working in an academic laboratory setting.

  Schultze-Kraft, M., Jonany, V., <mark><b>Binns, T.S.</b></mark>, Soch, J., Blankertz, B. and Haynes, J.D., 2021. Suppress me if you can: neurofeedback of the readiness potential. <i>eNeuro</i>, <i>8</i>(2). <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1523/eneuro.0425-20.2020">doi.org/10.1523/eneuro.0425-20.2020.</a>

  <p>
    Voluntary movements are usually preceded by a slow, negative-going brain signal over motor areas, the so-called readiness potential (RP). To date, the exact nature and causal role of the RP in movement preparation have remained heavily debated. Although the RP is influenced by several motorical and cognitive factors, it has remained unclear whether people can learn to exert mental control over their RP, for example, by deliberately suppressing it. If people were able to initiate spontaneous movements without eliciting an RP, this would challenge the idea that the RP is a necessary stage of the causal chain leading up to a voluntary movement. We tested the ability of participants to control the magnitude of their RP in a neurofeedback experiment. Participants performed self-initiated movements, and after every movement, they were provided with immediate feedback about the magnitude of their RP. They were asked to find a strategy to perform voluntary movements such that the RPs were as small as possible. We found no evidence that participants were able to to willfully modulate or suppress their RPs while still eliciting voluntary movements. This suggests that the RP might be an involuntary component of voluntary action over which people cannot exert conscious control.

      <b>British Neuroscience Associsation (BNA), Bristol, UK<br>
      Member</b><br>
      As a member of the BNA I have taken full advantage of the Association’s activities, attending talks and symposia to broaden my understanding of various neuroscience topics. Furthermore, I have also contributed an article examining the neuroscientific study of free will to the BNA’s Summer 2020 Bulletin, allowing me to demonstrate and further hone my academic writing skills.

<h1><a id="Skills" class="section-ID">Skills</a></h1>

<div>
  <h3 class="CV-header">Technical</h3>
    <p class="CV-desc">
      I am highly confident programming in MATLAB and Python, and am familiar with SPSS, Microsoft Office programs, NEURON, and Git. Additionally, I have much experience conducting EEG and behavioural experiments, and also possess fundamental skills in basic laboratory techniques such as electrophoresis, ELISA, and endonuclease use. Furthermore, I can quickly familiarise myself with new software and learn new techniques to add to my repertoire.
    </p>
  <h3 class="CV-header">Research</h3>
    <p class="CV-desc">
      Through my Honours project, industrial placement, and work as a research assistant, I have been involved in all facets of the research process, from literature review, experimental design, and writing ethics proposals, to data collection and analysis, to write up. This has instilled within me the confidence, independence, and critical thinking required to devise and undertake successful, scientifically rigorous research projects.
    </p>
  <h3 class="CV-header">Communication</h3>
    <p class="CV-desc">
      My communication skills have been honed through my engagement in presentations and scientific report writing, as well as through extracurricular roles such as Class Representative and House Captain. With this diverse experience, I am able to communicate information effectively to a range of audiences, from scientific experts to laymen.
    </p>
  <h3 class="CV-header">Teamwork</h3>
    <p class="CV-desc">
      Proficient teamwork skills have played an essential part of my education, having been involved in a number of successful group projects, including work in professional, academic laboratory settings such as the Bernstein Center and University of Aberdeen’s School of Psychology and School of Medicine, Medical Sciences, and Nutrition. My engagement in these projects has ensured that I am able to work cohesively with others in both smaller and larger groups.

    <p class="CV-desc">
      Upon completion of my MSci degree I was honoured to receive the University of Aberdeen’s prize for best neuroscience student, a yearly prize presented to a student on the Neuroscience degree programme in recognition of the individual’s excellent performance during their time at the university.
    </p>
  <h3 class="CV-header">Sports</h3>
    <p class="CV-desc">
      I am an avid athlete and member of the University of Aberdeen Athletics Society, and in the past have represented my school in the Lewisham Cross-Country Championship. Through my strong discipline and self-motivation I am able to adhere to a rigorous exercise regime, alongside which I am currently training for a half marathon. This is testament to both my dedication and well-rounded character.
    </p>
  <h3 class="CV-header">Music</h3>
    <p class="CV-desc">
      I have played the drum kit for fourteen years, achieving a Distinction at Grade 8. Since entering university I have been the drummer for the University of Aberdeen’s Jazz Band, playing at numerous concerts, including yearly performances at the Aberdeen Jazz Festival and the University of Aberdeen’s Concert Series. Previously, I have been involved in Lewisham Music Service’s African Drumming Group and Samba Band. I have also taken up the piano, achieving a Distinction at Grade 1. My participation in these activities has enhanced both my communication and teamwork skills greatly, and again attests to my well-rounded character and the fact that I remain dedicated to all routes I pursue.
