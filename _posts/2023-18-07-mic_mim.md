title: "MNE-Connectivity: Compute multivariate measures of the imaginary part of coherency"
layout: post
---

This example demonstrates how multivariate methods based on the imaginary part of coherency can be used to compute connectivity between whole sets of sensors, and how spatial patterns of this connectivity can be interpreted. The methods in question are: the maximised imaginary part of coherency (MIC); and the multivariate interaction measure (MIM; as well as its extension, the global interaction measure, GIM).
